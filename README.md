## Problem Statement

Develop a frontend in Reactjs or Nextjs, which does the following:

1. Renders a "profile screen" as follows: https://www.terriblytinytales.com/profile.jpeg (this is a sample screenshot taken from mobile view)

2. The profile data can be hardcoded in a local JSON and need not have a backend.

3. The screen when opened on different mobile types, should render consistently. This can be checked in Chrome Inspect in mobile view, by changing device types or on actual physical devices.
